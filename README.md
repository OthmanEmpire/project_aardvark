## Team Aardvark--Restaurant Booking And Billing System

This project represents a client-server desktop application intended to be used
in restaurants for management purposes. The front-end is a PyQt desktop
application while the backend runs a Django server.

Team Aardvark was the name of our group for the 2nd year group project at
University. In addition to the final product, the intention of the project was
to explore software development methodologies. In particular, we adapted a
Scrum approach (see Wiki).

## Key Features

* Restaurant menu is fetched from Django server and can be easily modified.
* Booking of available slots through client application.
* Implementation of a restaurant menu cart associated with a table.
* Handling of customer payment and storing transaction history (incomplete)


## Requirements

* Python 3+
  * Django (2.0.2)
  * Sphinx (1.6.3)
  * model-mommy (1.5.1)
  * requests (2.18.4)
  * PyQt5 (5.10.1)


## How to Run

#### Simple Method

Automatically create a local virtual environment and install the necessary
packages into it by running:

    install.bat

Thereafter, launch the server and then connect to it via a client by running:

    runClient.bat
    runServer.bat

#### Fight Me Method

You can manually install the necessary packages thereafter invoking the server
and client via `setup.py`. The full list of commands available are mentioned
below:

    python setup.py runClient
    python setup.py runServer
    python setup.py runTest
    python setup.py runManualTest
    python setup.py runClean
    python setup.py generateDoc
    python setup.py runDoc

For further built-in **bonus** commands by default, seek help via:

    python setup.py --help-commands
