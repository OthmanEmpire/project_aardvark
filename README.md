The project has been largely automated via the setup.py file. In summary, the
 custom added commands can be run directly from command line by entering:
 
    python setup.py runInstallation
    python setup.py runClient <SERVER_SOCKET>
    python setup.py runTests
    python setup.py runClean

To explore further default and some built-in bonus commands, seek help via:
    
    python setup.py --help-commands
